CAT VS DOG CLASSIFICATION
This project aims to build a deep learning model that classifies images as dogs or cats using a simple Kaggle dataset. The model employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and utilizes normalization as a data preprocessing technique to enhance training efficiency and accuracy.
The dataset contains labeled images of dogs and cats, and the model is trained to learn the distinctive visual features of each category. By using CNNs, the model extracts key features from the images and performs classification. Normalization was applied to the images to standardize pixel values, ensuring better convergence during training and improving model performance.This project demonstrates the potential of CNNs in image classification tasks, with a simple yet effective approach that can be expanded for more complex datasets or additional categories.
